**Features**:

#. Automatic graphs downloading from `Konect <http://konect.cc/networks/>`_ and `networkrepository <http://networkrepository.com/>`_ online collections.
#. Graph statistics (including centralities) can be calculated and are stored together with the graphs.
#. Several families of crawlers implemented:

   * popular ones: RandomCrawler, RandomWalkCrawler, BreadthFirstSearchCrawler, DepthFirstSearchCrawler, MaximumObservedDegreeCrawler, PreferentialObservedDegreeCrawler;
   * multicrawler mode - when a set of crawlers work together;
   * advanced crawlers - for more complex strategies.
#. Run crawlers on given graphs, calculating quality measures, saving the history, and drawing plots.

**Planning**:

* graph models: controlled assortativity, ERGG.
