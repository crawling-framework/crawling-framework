Project description
===================


The CrawlingFramework (`source code <https://github.com/crawling-framework/crawling-framework.github.io>`_) is aimed for offline testing of network crawling algorithms on social graphs. 
Undirected graphs without self-loops are supported.

Currently, framework allows reproducing experiments from the paper "Amplifying Online Learning with 
Graph Neural Networks for Selective Harvesting over Social Networks" (not published).

**Features**:

* Run crawlers on given graphs, calculating quality measures, saving the history, and drawing plots.
